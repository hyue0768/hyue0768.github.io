<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My name is Yue HUANG, my MBTI is INFJ-T, with 92% Introversion and 94% Judging. I am now working as a Research Assistant supervised by [Prof Duan Huayi](https://tint-research.com/index) and will switch to PhD student in Jan. 2026. In October 2025, I earned my MPhil degree from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) under the guidance of [Prof. Jing TANG](https://sites.google.com/view/jtang). 
<!-- Before pursuing the Mphil degree, I earned a B.Eng degree in Computer Science and Technology from Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering with the mentorship of Prof. Shuangyin Liu. -->
I am deeply interested in the Blockchain Security and Large Language Model.

<!-- I would graduate in 2025 October. I am looking for a **<font color=red>potential Ph.D position</font>** related to blockchain and security. If you are interested in my experiences, please feel free to reach out through hhhhhy499 AT gmail.com. -->

> If you’re interested in collaborating or exploring potential research opportunities, please don’t hesitate to reach out (带带弟弟 in Chinese).


I have maintained a [github repo](https://github.com/hyue0768/paper_list), collecting paper regarding Blockchain and Crypto. Also, I contributed some PRs(Top 3 contributor) towards a similar [repo](https://github.com/hzysvilla/Academic_Smart_Contract_Papers).
